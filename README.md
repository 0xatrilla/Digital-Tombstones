## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Modern SwiftUI**: Pure SwiftUI with Model-View (MV) architecture
- **No ViewModels**: Uses SwiftUI's native state management (@State, @Observable, @Environment)
- **Swift Package Manager**: Modular architecture with SPM packages
- **Workspace Structure**: Clean separation between app shell and feature code

### Requirements
- **iOS**: 26.0 or later (with optional iOS 26.0 features)
- **Xcode**: 26.0 or later
- **Swift**: 6.1 or later
- **Device**: iPhone (optimized for all screen sizes)

### Data Source
The app fetches real-time data from the official [Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com) project repository, ensuring you always have the latest information about Google's discontinued products.

## Project Structure

```
KilledByGoogle/
â”œâ”€â”€ KilledByGoogle.xcworkspace/              # Open this file in Xcode
â”œâ”€â”€ KilledByGoogle.xcodeproj/                # App shell project
â”œâ”€â”€ KilledByGoogle/                          # App target (minimal)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Assets.xcassets/                # App-level assets (icons, colors)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ KilledByGoogleApp.swift              # App entry point
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ KilledByGoogle.xctestplan            # Test configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ KilledByGooglePackage/                   # ðŸš€ Primary development area
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Package.swift                   # Package configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sources/KilledByGoogleFeature/       # Your feature code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Tests/KilledByGoogleFeatureTests/    # Unit tests
â””â”€â”€ KilledByGoogleUITests/                   # UI automation tests
```

## Key Architecture Points

### Workspace + SPM Structure
- **App Shell**: `KilledByGoogle/` contains minimal app lifecycle code
- **Feature Code**: `KilledByGooglePackage/Sources/KilledByGoogleFeature/` is where most development happens
- **Separation**: Business logic lives in the SPM package, app target just imports and displays it

### Buildable Folders (Xcode 16)
- Files added to the filesystem automatically appear in Xcode
- No need to manually add files to project targets
- Reduces project file conflicts in teams

## Development Notes

### Code Organization
Most development happens in `KilledByGooglePackage/Sources/KilledByGoogleFeature/` - organize your code as you prefer.

### Public API Requirements
Types exposed to the app target need `public` access:
```swift
public struct NewView: View {
    public init() {}
    
    public var body: some View {
        // Your view code
    }
}
```

Remember to mark types as `public` when they need to be accessed by the app target.

### Testing

Run tests using:
- **Unit Tests**: âŒ˜+U in Xcode or `swift test` in the package directory
- **UI Tests**: Select the UI test scheme and run

Tests use the modern Swift Testing framework with `@Test` attributes and `#expect` assertions.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes in the `KilledByGooglePackage` directory
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style

- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI's declarative patterns
- Prefer `struct` over `class` for data models
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations
- Write tests for new functionality
